# information-visualization
This repo is dedicated to our information visualization project



# Interaction
Show an overview of the whole data set and then show a subset of it, use multiform, facet, 
show for example the bad subset of polluants

# Tasks to realize and things to avoid


Project :
	Avoid large number,
	Use log scale, for small values
	Avoid brightness color, and try to see if the color is necessary and it givs information

- Try to find correlation between pairs of polluants!!! very important	
-keep the user choose a date and show him the concentration over day..
- Choose the best labels for your visualization
- remove the number in the station address
- show the peak of the concentration by day, by heure de point 16,17 ou midi
- In the presentation show the threshold provided in measurment info
- Set a threshold for each linechart of polluant in order to see when the plot cross the average threshold,

- Allow user to adjust the threshold maybe it a plus!
- Choose the effective polluant and put it as color in all graphs
